# Purpose

For the purpose of this project we wanted design and implement a virtual pet based on the old Digimon pets of the late 1990s and early 2000s. We wanted to create a virtual pet that invoked nostalgia from this particular era for adults, and also have children of today being able to play a similar iteration of the game on a cellphone application. These virtual pets have multiple use cases for today, especially with the current Covid climate. A child can use this as a chance to care for their pet and choose the different paths that are possible within the game, and an older user can use this as a nostalgic flashback, as well as getting one for their child and playing the game with them.

# Functionality / Features

This web app will comprise of the ability to help in the survival and life longevity of a virtual pet. Each pet will comprise of attributes that allow you to keep the pet healthy, and if the pet has been neglected, then the user will have the ability to 'clean' the pet to make them healthy again. The user will be able to feed their pet should they be hungry with the click of a food icon, clean them up with a click of the health icon, be able to choose the life cycle/evolution of your pet, as well as the ability to restart the pet should you want to try a new evolution cycle or have accidentally let your pet die. The app will also consist of logic to determine when these 'bodily functions' take place. We can use this game logic to alert the user when they need to feed their pet, or if they have neglected their pet and they need to pay more attention to it. The web app will also have ability to create an account with password and email credentials, allowing the user to login and logout of their account, to ensure that they can keep their pets to themselves, and for the younger generation the ability to make sure that their virtual pet is not tampered with by other children.

- Ability to feed your pet
- Ability to clean your pet
- Ability to restart life cycle of your pet
- Ability to evolve through different life cycles of different oath options.
- Ability to have your own pet through creating of account and having login credentials
- Game logic to determine the life cycle of the virtual pet
- Interactive evolution of life cycle

# Target Audience

The target audience for this web application varies across many age brackets as well as catering for different demographics. The app can be used by children who are after a simple game, that requires their attention every so often to maintain the health of the virtual pet. Adults wanting a nice nostalgic flash back to play a game that they have enjoyed earlier in their life, simply using this application they can once again care for a virtual pet. Having the ability to feed and clean up after your pet, the same as it was previously designed will be implemented within this web app also. Also this demographic can include parents who want to introduce their children to the game as well, having played the game themselves and having an understanding of it can guide their children through the process. Using this web app as a distraction for parents is also a possibility during these times where parents are at home working and looking after their children at the same time due to Covid 19.

- If your monster is SICK for too long it may DIE

- When logging in you may be greeted with a TOMBSTONE instead of a monster this indicates you let your poor pet DIEâ€¦
- Click on the RESET link to restart and get a new egg.
- Your monster has hidden death value that when it reaches 0 your pet will DIE; you can never see what this value is and will only know itâ€™s zero when you get a TOMBSTONE.
  Causes of death:
- Monster has empty HUNGER (0/5) meter for 1 hour (-1 point)
- Monster has empty STRENGTH (0/5) meter for 1 hour (-1 point)
- Monster get SICK (-1 point)
- Monster is SICK for 1 hour (-1 point)
- Note: Effects can stack
- Death value can not be recovered however when you monster EVOLVES to the next stage the value is reset, so even if your pet nearly dies in one form it will start fresh in the next evolution.

#### Evolution

- EVOLUTION happens if your monster does not die from neglect when you log into the game and the EVOLUTION TIMER counted down to zero.
  A popup will show with a choice of available monsters for your monster to EVOLVE into, Press/Click on one of the choices to select it and complete the transformation!

# R4 User Stories

Terry, 36, is after an web app that she is able to give to her children, for them to use while she is working at home during Covid 19. Terry would like the web app to have some security measures to ensure that the game is safe for her children, including such things as being able to have passwords so no one can access her children's accounts, and the ability to sign out off the web app as well, to make sure her other children cannot 'muck around' with each others accounts.

1. As Terry, i want my children to be able to have their own pet so that my children aren't fighting over a single pet to play with.
2. As Terry, i want my children to be able to sign out of their accounts so that my other children cannot 'restart' their games.
3. As Terry i want my children to be able to restart the pet, so that if they forget about the app they are able to restart a game.

Tommy, 8, wants to play a game while he is on school holidays that lets him have a virtual pet that can evolve and he can share his progress with his friends. Tommy wants his pet to be safe from his friends deleting it as a cruel joke, so there must be a login page where you can have a password for security. Tommy wants to know how his pet is doing and wants it to be able to evolve and also wants to make sure that there are penalties for being a bad carer, and also rewards (evolution) for correctly caring for your pet

4. As Tommy, i want my pet to be able to evolve so that i know i have been caring for to correctly.
5. As Tommy, i want to be able to feed my virtual pet to ensure that it stays alive and can evolve properly.
6. As Tommy, i want to be able to clean up my pets poo, so that it stays healthy and does not die.

Rob, 30, is wanting to relive the splendid days of his youth. He wants once again to play a game that requires him to care for a virtual pet. He wants the ability to login to his pet and check how it is going, he wants authentication on the app and wants to be able to sign out of the app and the progress is still being taken note of. He want to know when his pet is being taken care of properly (evolving) and wants to know when the pet has been neglected, and needs to be cleaned up. He also wants the ability to choose a path for the pet evolution.

7. As Rob, i want to be able to create an account so that it only allows me to access it with email and password credentials.
8. As Rob, i want to be able to sign out of my account so that i know no one else can access my virtual pet after i have logged out.
9. As Rob, i want to be able to heal my virtual pet with a healing button so that the pet doesn't die.

With these personas complete with 'what' and 'why' accounts, we can ascertain the features that the app will compromise of to fulfill the needs of the personas:

- Can account that has authentication abilities
- Sign up page with password and email verification
- Login page with email and password
- Sign out option once logged in
- Game logic to handle taking care and responding to neglecting of virtual pet
- Ability to restart a new pet, when either an old pet has died or when a user wants to start again

# R5 Wireframes for multiple standard screen sizes, created using industry standard software

Our application was designed with mobile first in mind with locked dimensions for mobile resolution, the main reason for this is because small sprites will be used and stretching them to larger resolutions will give an undesirable appearance. Therefore we have only included 2 Tablet and Browser wireframes to demonstrate dimensions.

# R6 Screenshots of your Trello board demonstrating use throughout the initial stages of the project

Worked on finalising idea, understanding all diagrams and, wireframes, user stories
![](Docs/Trello1.png)
Continued working on part A of project and making sure that all is correct and work on R1 for the part A
![](Docs/Trello2.png)
Start setting up the Rails backend for the project, and use TDD as a way of developing our application, using the tests to ensure we are using the TDD principles along the way. Aim to set up Heroku and Netlify and start on generating the models for the User and Monster
![](Docs/Trello3.png)
Today we aim to finish the Model tests/build and aim to start on the controllers testing and building, as well as setting up Knock and Bcrypt for the authentication of the application.
![](Docs/Trello4.png)
We aimed today to try and finish the testing on the backend of the application, will use today and tomorrow to try and get this done, ran into some problems, where we had to go back and reconfigure some of the tests to make sure that the tests don't break when we set up authentication, this took up a lot of time over the next two days, and if we didn't do now, we would have to come back and do them later.
![](Docs/Trello5.png)
Today we aim to have the backend all hooked up to the front end, receiving requests from the front end, and then making sure that Netlify and Heroku are set up with each other also.  
![](Docs/Trello5.png)

Part B - For the process of implementing code, we decided to pair program the project, so there was no task delegation throughout for us to document. However, we used Trello as a time management tool for our project. We have attached the screenshots of Trello with a description of what was planned and achieved throughout each particular day.

Monday - As of today we will focus on the front-end for the majority of the project unless we have to add some migrations for columns in the backend. Setting up the sign up and login forms for users to fill in, as well as setting up the react routes with Browser Router, have that we will work on game logic, however o think that this will be started later in the week, when we have everything else sorted out and working correctly with the front and backend.  
![](Docs/Trello-Monday.png)
![](Docs/Trello-Monday2.png)
Tuesday - Today we are aiming to add some more React components, looking to have the Navbar render conditionally depending the state pf the user and whether they are logged in or not. As well as some tests on the backend again, making sure that the current user has a monster id attached. Working on signing in and signing up functionality.
![](Docs/Trello-Tuesday.png)
![](Docs/Trello-Tuesday2.png)
Wednesday- Want to start to incorporate some front end tests using Cypress, and want to add the Monster component, as well as finishing the remaining components. Still working on fixing the conditional rendering Navbar.Potentially work on implementing CI/CD.
![](Docs/Trello-Wednesday.png)
Friday - Thursday and today we have worked on setting up when the Monster gets updated that it sends back the updated Monster to us through a PUT request and we then update monster simultaneously in the backend when it gets sent (every 3s). Worked on breaking the sprites up into pieces allowing us to use them as a gif, looking to make a start on the game logic over the weekend, we have made a change to one of the controllers and need to check the Rspec tests to make sure that the tests dont break and alow for the extra param coming through.
![](Docs/Friday.png)
Monday Week 2 - Aim to finish Cypress testing, working on finishing the game logic by Tuesday/Wednesday . Thinking of using created at timestamp for the age of the Monster, but may just use a timer relating to all of the other attributes that the Monster has. Use setInterval to run the components in the desired time frame. Plan to re-deploy today , will see how we go.
![](Docs/Monday.png)
![](Docs/Monday2b.png)
Tuesday Week 2- Finish up game logic and import sprites to be used at the correct time with the evolution of the game. Put on the final touches of the game logic. Start styling, have decided to use SASS for styling instead of Bulma, decided that Bulma style was too opinionated and didn't suit the style of our application.
![](Docs/Tuesday2b.png)
Wednesday - finish the styling today and re-deploy, ran into an error involving Git, our branches weren't correctly up to date and had to re-run a heroku run rails db:seed to ensure we were getting the correct login for the components, and they were updating state correctly.
![](Docs/Wednesday2.png)
Thursday - Final, just working on touch ups and fixing the Navbar conditional rendering problem that we had at the start of last week.Working on the documentation as well. Installed Rubocop for linting and rectified syntax. Finishing up on manual testing and potentially working on some final details before hand in at 10pm.
